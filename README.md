# for572-scripts
A completely unsupported set of scripts used in SANS FOR572, Advanced Network Forensics and Analysis

Note to any FOR572 students: These scripts are already incorporated into your SIFT Workstation VM. They should not be run manually or outside the class workbook or other guidance. I only have them in GitHub for convenience and ease-of-updates! :)
